## Technical Writings

1. Training Handout for Non-linguist Human Participants
   - This handout focuses on training participants to produce reliable linguistic judgements regarding three logical relations, namely Contradiction, Entailment, and Neutral. The human judgements produced can be compared with those generated by an LLM to help fine-tune the model.
     
2. Applied English Writing Course Materials
      
      - Two sample writings that were used as course materials to teach the features of technical writing:
   
         a. How to Insert Citations and Bibliographies in Microsoft Word
   
         b. How to Make Your Instagram Account Private on Desktop
